	<div class = "Story">
		<p>The idea of conference realignment is not a new trend in college athletics, especially in football. Throughout the past thirty years, there has been a seismic shift in the structure and culture of college athletics, causing many schools to switch their allegiances and move to another conference. No matter what school moves to what conference, there is one consistent motive at play, money. College athletic programs are always looking for ways to generate more revenue for their schools. Largely due to the pandemic, many NCAA Division 1 athletic conferences lost significant revenue from 2016-2021 and have been put in a position where they need to find larger sources of financial support.</p>

	<p>Alot of times the greatest generators of revenue are the media rights and football programs a school is involved in. The movement of one school to a new conference can create a domino effect that goes beyond one of the five power conferences: BIG 10, BIG 12, ACC, SEC, and PAC 12.</p>
			<p> Realignment has affected every one of these major conferences in college athletics. Since 2013, the ACC has added Syracuse, Louisville, and Pittsburgh, bringing the number of teams to 16, with Notre Dame as a partial member. These schools helped to replace Maryland which left the ACC for the BIG 10, a conference that added Rutgers in 2014. In 2012, the SEC added Missouri and Texas A&M from the BIG 12, which also lost Colorado, but added West Virginia and TCU that same year. Recently it seems, conference realignment seems to have been kicked up to another level, and with it, the fabric of college athletics may have been ruined as well.</p>
		<p>On July 23, 2021, the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma announced that their athletic programs would leave the Big 12 Conference and join the Southeastern Conference, flipping the NCAA on its head. At this <a href="https://www.outkick.com/cfb-analyst-says-espn-big-12-fallout-will-push-texas-oklahoma-to-sec-in-2022/" target = "_blank">moment</a>,it was clear that there was no going back for the sport of college football. About a year later, UCLA and USC made an announcement that they were going to leave the Pacific-12 Conference and join the Big Ten Conference. The main motive for these two moves is quite simple, revenue. By joining the SEC and Big 10 respectively, the four schools can generate significantly more revenue in their new conferences than if they stayed in the Big 12 or PAC-12. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/why-texas-and-oklahoma-want-to-move-to-the-sec-follow-the-money.html" target = "_blanl"> CNBC </a>,Texas and OU can each reportedly receive about $60 million annually from the SEC compared to the $34 million that they would have received from the Big 12. Major media networks such as ESPN can benefit tremendously from the new conferences which only helped to accelerate the transformation of college athletics. In December 2020, ESPN was negotiating a new media rights deal with the SEC which included a $3 billion dollar investment, largely tied to the inclusion of Oklahoma and Texas. The SEC will also benefit from the new media deal with an estimated 3% gain in revenue from the ESPN contract.The Big Ten will gain around $7 billion in their new media deal signed in August 2022. While these new “super conferences” will benefit significantly from the new media rights, many institutions are being left behind and could be permanently affected. </p>

		<iframe title="Percent of revenue generated through media rights" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-E0Bzo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/E0Bzo/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="449" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
<p>Take for example the Big 12 and Pacific 12 conferences. The money generated from their media distribution through the NCAA accounts for around 35% of their total revenue, largely due to the competition within those leagues. In the Big 12 specifically, Texas and Oklahoma participating in the league is a massive draw for a television audience, and losing them could be drastic. According to data from SportsMediaWatch.com, average viewership in Big 12 games that do not include Texas or Oklahoma dropped by nearly 2 million people and is around the same as the American Atheltic Conference, a mid-major. While not as significant, USC and UCLA leaving the Pac-12 creates a massive national hole that will be difficult for the conference to fill. The Pac-12 will still have the national appeal of programs such as Oregon and Arizona, however, there is also a strong chance that either of those schools leaves for another conference as well.</p> 

<p>A common thread among the schools that are changing conferences, and gaining revenue from the new media deals, is that they all have prominent, national football programs. 
FBS football is the biggest driver of broadcasting rights and the biggest college football games have the potential to draw some of the largest audiences for a sporting event. Two of the highest-viewed games this season came from the SEC and Big 10: Tennesse-Alabama (11.557 million) and Ohio State-Michigan (17 million viewers). The biggest programs want to play in the biggest games against the best competition possible which now aligns with switching conferences.</p>

<p>The future of college athletics is in flux. The addition of Name, Image and Likeness and the expansion of the transfer portal has largely taken amateurism of out the sport and made the NCAA closer to a professional league than it has ever been. Of all the drastic changes that have come into the world of collegiate athletics, conference realignment has been the most impactful and has completely changed the competitive landscape of the NCAA. While the rich will continue to get richer from these new developments, smaller schools that may lack the resources to contend with Power 5 may be left in the dust.</p>
